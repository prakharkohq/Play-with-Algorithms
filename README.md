## Algorithms and Data Structures - Course Official Code Warehouse

Hello everyone, welcome everyone to my practical course [Molecular and Data Structure] on [Mu Tuo Net] (http://www.imooc.com/) (http://coding.imooc.com /class/71.html) The official code bin. This code warehouse will not only contain all the source code of the course, but also release the updated content of the course, errata information and more of the program can enrich the content of the course, such as more sharing, more practice, and so on. The course source is currently only available in C++ and Java. For more language support, I will slowly update this code bin in the future (although it is expected to be snail speed >_<).

You can download, run, test, and modify. If you find any bugs or have comments or suggestions about anything in the course, please contact me :)

## Course Update Information

* **v2.0** The full set of courses is equipped with Java code (including additional content of existing C++ code). See the Java code section of the [Course Source Directory] (https://github.com/liuyubobobo/Play-with-Algorithms#Course Source Directory) for details.

* **v1.1** Full course with supplemental content

    * Note: For additional code, please refer to the [Course Source Directory] (https://github.com/liuyubobobo/Play-with-Algorithms#Course Source Directory) for each subsequent chapter. ** Not all supplements contain source code**. Supplemental content is not an integral part of course learning. For your extended extension ideas, please use.
    
    * Regarding the supplementary content, it can be ignored for the overall study of the course. ** It is recommended to complete the necessary part of the course and then study the supplementary content as appropriate**.
    
    * For supplements that don't have source code, I will update the code from time to time, but I don't guarantee the time. A lot of content is what I think of, put it in the catalog, for everyone to expand their ideas. You can also write your own code to complete the supplementary content, I believe it is a good programming exercise:) Come on!
    
* **v 1.0** Full course online

## more recommendations

* Thanks to the study course [**@ShiveryMoon**] (https://github.com/ShiveryMoon) The classmates used the Python language to implement all the code of the course, and even many extensions and additions. Students who use the Python language can go to the code warehouse of Daxie. Portal: [https://github.com/ShiveryMoon/Imooc-Algorithm-PythonEdition] (https://github.com/ShiveryMoon/Imooc-Algorithm-PythonEdition)

* Thanks to the study course [**@摘星fy**] (https://github.com/kingAnyWHere) Visualization of many algorithms based on Canvas. Interested students can go to the code warehouse of Daxie. At the same time, [**@上星fy**](https://github.com/kingAnyWHere) also implemented many algorithms in my two courses, "Playing Data Structure" and "visible algorithm" based on Canvas. And the visual content of the data structure, don't miss it!
